Examples for learning to use pthreads
=====================================

These are some code examples that I used to learn the basics 
of multi-threading on C using
[pthreads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX_Threads) in Linux.

Most of them are taken from these tutorials:
- Alfred Park's [Multithreaded Programming](https://randu.org/tutorials/threads/)
- Blaise Barney's [POSIX Threads Programming](https://computing.llnl.gov/tutorials/pthreads/)
